      # SSH into the machine. If the machine is not at a point where
      # SSH is even possible, then `nil` should be returned.
      #
      # The general structure of this returned hash should be the
      # following:
      #
      #     {

      #     }
      #
      # **Note:** Vagrant only supports private key based authenticatonion,
      # mainly for the reason that there is no easy way to exec into an
      # `ssh` prompt with a password, whereas we can pass a private key
      # via commandline.
